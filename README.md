+ Project summary: In this project, we implement two algorithms: Learning fair representations (LFR) and Fairness-aware Classifier with Prejudice Remover Regularizer (PR) on compas-two-years dataset. We compare two algorithms' performance on dataset by accuracy, discrimination and calibration. 
	
**Contribution statement**: Xinyun Li codes implement the LFR algorithm and Alix Leon code and implement the PR algorithms. Jinyang Cai designed the evalutaion metrics and perform the data cleaning with John Podias. Xinyun Li and Jingyang Cai wrote the presentation files together.
